# MiniHawk-artwork
Mechanical artwork for the MiniHawk VTOL, the successor to the OrangeHawk VTOL.

# MiniHawk Build Parts List and Tools:
## Recommended Tools and Equipment
 - FDM/FFF 3D Printer with build volume greater than 23.1x210.7x330.0mm (Dimensions of largest part, which is Left/Right Wing. Adventurous builders might try printing larger parts in sections)
 - Soldering Station and associated tools and materials
 - Handcrafting Tools
 - Adhesives: Cyanoacrylate Glue, Epoxy, Hot-Melt Adhesive Gun, Tape
   
## Components and Electronics:
 - qty:1 Flight Controller (3 Motor, 4 Servo Outputs)(Matek Systems F722-WING)
 - qty:3 ESCs (3s, 20A or better)(Spedix ES20 Lite)
 - qty:2 BE1806 2300KV BLCD Motors (or equivalent, must be no larger than OutsideDiameter=24mm, able to produce between 350g to 500g static thrust and pitch speed of ~20m/s with 5in prop)
 - qty:1 BE2206 2000KV (or equivalent, may be up to OutsideDiameter=30mm, between 700g to 1000g static thrust)
 - qty:1 3s1300 Lipoly (better than 40C)
 - qty:2 HS-65HB Servos (Servo pockets designed for up to 26mm wide, 17.5mm from bottom of mounting tabs to bottom of servo, 32mm from top of output shaft to bottom of servo, 12mm thick. Should fit most "Sub-Micro" Servos)
 - qty:2 HS-65MG Servos (Same pocket dimensions as above, but these are going to be fantastically abused and must be really tough. Or just count on stripping your non-metal-gear servos a lot.)
 - qty:6 Du-Bro Small Nylon Hinges (Can be omitted but 3D-printed living-hinge on elevons will eventually fail, mend appropriately)
 - Either M2 or M3 Nylon Standoff and Spacer hardware for mounting Flight Controller.
 - qty:4 6-Inch Servo Extension Cables. Alternatively, cut the servo cables and solder in-line extensions for the cables to reach to the flight controller, plus some slack.
 - qty:4 Du-Bro Kwik Link Clevis for 0.72-inch (2-56) threaded rod/wire. Two of these for the Elevon Servos, two for the motor tilt servos.
 - qty:2 2-56 Threaded Linkage Rods with L-bend at 45mm from threaded tip. These connect from the Elevon Servos to the Elevon Control Horns. 
 > (Note that the above clevises and rods can be purchased as a set, such as Du-Bro Item #185, which is a set of 5 rods with clevises already attached)
 - qty:2 Du-Bro E/Z Links 0.72 (2-56) Retainer Clips. These secure the L-Bend at the Elevon Control Horns.
 - qty:2 1/16 2-56 Threaded Ball Link, such as GreatPlanes GPMQ3843. **CRITICAL!!! The Ball Link thread must be "116", 1/16-inch, 62.5mil, or 1.59mm.** The more popular variant is the 2-56 thread size ball, which is too big for the nacelle motor tilt attachment. Note that this is the ball-link thread size, the coupler that captures the ball is 2-56 threaded. This ball-link set attaches from the motor tilt servo linkage to the motor tilt mount, which holds the front left/right motor.
 - qty:2 2-56 Fully-Threaded Rods, straight, 60mm long. One end threads to Du-Bro Kwik Link 2-56 Clevis, other end threads to a 2-56 Ball Link coupler.
 - qty:2 Length=24mm, Diameter=[1.83mm to 1.87mm] Steel Rod (Formed from spare pieces of 2-56 Servo Pushrod. Use non-threaded smooth rod, roughen/knurl only one end slightly for press-fitting to nacelle)
 - (optional) qty:2 WS2812 or equivalent Addressable LED, 5050 SMD or smaller raw device. These are soldered with magnet wire and mounted in the wingtips.
